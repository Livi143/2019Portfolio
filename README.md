Determined to finish a STEM degree touching as little technology as I could, I studied pure mathematics. I completed my Bachelor's in December 2017 from the University of Colorado at Boulder. Post university, I dove headfirst into programming.  I haven't quite decided yet which is more challenging; programming or applied calculus. I am currently working as junior developer at a bank.
